In machine learning, classification is a supervised method of segmenting data points into various labels or classes. Unlike regression, the target variable in a classification problem is discrete. Each data point used in training classification models must have a corresponding label in order for the characteristics and patterns in the classes to be learnt appropriately. Classification can either be binary - identifying that a given email is spam or not or, multi-class - classifying a fruit as orange, mango or banana.
The National Footprint and Biocapacity Accounts (NFAs) measure the ecological resource use and resource capacity of nations from 1961 to 2016. The calculations in the National Footprint and Biocapacity Accounts are primarily based on United Nations data sets, including those published by the Food and Agriculture Organization, United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics Database, and the UN Statistics Division, as well as the International Energy Agency. In this project, we will use this data to classify and predict the quality metrics (qascore) of the ecological footprint data for the different countries. This data includes total and per capita national biocapacity, the ecological footprint of consumption, the ecological footprint of production and total area in hectares
