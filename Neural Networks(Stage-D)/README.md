# Neural Networks, Image Recognition and Object Detection - The Amazon Deforestation from Space


Every hour, the world loses an area of forest the size of 2500 Maracana Stadium - the biggest football field in the world. Deforestation of the Amazon Basin accounts for the largest share of the forest area lost. This contributes to reduced biodiversity, habitat loss, and climate change.

The architecture of the brain inspired the neural networks used to build intelligent machines.

In this course, we will explore the building blocks of neural networks, which are versatile, powerful, and scalable. We will learn how to use them to tackle complex problems like the use of convolutional neural networks for image recognition.
